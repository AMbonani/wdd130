        <p> Hello! My name is Abigail Mbonani, I am from South Africa. I am excited to be part of this class I am looking forward 
            to learning about websites and how they are built. I love technology and learning about all sorts of interesting topics. I spend my spare
            time reading articles and blogs on the internet. I also enjoy reading books, my favorite genre is autobiographies. My other hobbies
            are cooking, I enjoy trying out new recipes. I also enjoy being in the outdoors such as hiking, going to the beach and going out for a picnic.
        </p> 
        <p> I am married to a wonderful patient man and we have been blessed with two kids a girl 7 and a boy 15 months old. I love the 
            gospel it has blessed my life, I have been a member since I was a child.
